						computer science ecosystems,
						planning and developing
						solutions to automate and
						optimize both new and existing
						workflows.

						<br />
						While not working, I love to practice
						the clarinet, write short stories,
						and play video games. I am also passionate
						about the outdoors and enjoy camping,
						hiking, mountain biking, and skiing.
